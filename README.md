# Website using the warframe API that shows worldstate, alert and news info: https://docs.warframestat.us/
## TODO:
* Refactor javascript (will become a huge mess if features are added)
* Improve caching (redirect to warframe api when cache misses and currently implemented as plain json files)
* Prototype item trade value page
  - Data possibly from warframe.market API

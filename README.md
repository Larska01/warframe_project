## How to run
* Clone and run server.go and data/scheduling.py

## TODO:
* Refactor javascript (will become a huge mess if features are added)
* Improve caching (redirect to warframe api when cache misses and currently implemented as plain json files)
* Prototype item trade value page
  - Data possibly from warframe.market API
